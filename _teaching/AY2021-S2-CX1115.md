Quicklinks for slides | [Lab 1](https://yihao001.github.io/teaching/CX1115/lab1.html) | [Lab 2](https://yihao001.github.io/teaching/CX1115/lab2.html) |

Here are some additional resources that builds on top of the lab materials. It goes beyond what's covered in the lab manual, but these are additional questions you should think about. Answers are hidden ;)

(Hint: this is written using Markdown - you can either check out the GitHub repo or view source)

Lab 1 
===

In the text below, `df` refers to any arbitrary DataFrame. 

> M1 DataAcqusition.ipynb

1. Look at the documentation for `pd.DataFrame(data)` to better understand what it can / cannot do. 

    `Series, arrays, constants, dataclass or list-like objects. If data is a dict, column order follows insertion-order.`

    It only accepts lists, dictionaries, `pd.Series`, `np.array`. [List-like objects](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.api.types.is_list_like.html) include tuples and sets. Do check out [dataclass](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47955263/what-are-data-classes-and-how-are-they-different-from-common-classes), but it's relatively new and not that widely used yet (you might need to know OOP to fully appreciate it too).

2. All the data imports in the notebook works well and loads into the df nicely, but real life data is more problematic than this! We'll see more examples along the way.

3. When importing HTML tables into df, why are there NaNs? Open the link and right click on any tables (e.g. Cast) and click `Inspect` to look at the code.
<!-- There's an empty <tr> in the first row ; first column is NaN because it contains images. If you want these images, you'll need to write your own web scraping script! -->

4. Stick with the way information is accessed, i.e. `canteens_df["Name"]` and `canteens_df.iloc[0]`.

    You might chance upon other ways of accessing rows (e.g. `canteens_df.name`) or columns (`canteens_df.iat[0]`). The former doesn't work with column name with spaces. For the latter, `.iat` is lightly faster than `.iloc`, but if performance is really an issue you should stick to Numpy - df is generally much slower. See [this link](https://medium.com/dunder-data/minimally-sufficient-pandas-a8e67f2a2428) for more details.

5. What exactly does `class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'` mean when you type `type(df)`?

    DataFrame is a class defined in a file called `frame.py` in a folder named `core` which is in a folder named `pandas`. That's just how the Pandas developers organised their code.

    You can see the file in [Panda's GitHub repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/frame.py)


> Exercise1.ipynb

You should be able to complete the two problems by yourself. 

For the bonus problem, here are the column names of the UCI dataset to spare you from some manual entry:

```
['age', 'workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'education-num', 'marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week', 'native-country', 'income']
```

You'll still need to take care of some parameters in `read_csv()`.
<!-- Clue: index_col and header -->

Definition of `fnlwgt` isn't very clear - my interpretation is that it's an approximation of the number of people in the US that have similar demographic info as described by that row. If you try to sum the column up, you'll get 6 billion - that's probably because there are quite a lot of overlaps. 

1. Notice that there are several columns with `NaN`. We will learn how do deal this in later classes (generally we drop the column if there are too many NaNs, if there's only a few missing cells we can fill it in - there are many ways to do so and what's appropriate depends on the dataset).

2. As usual, be very careful about the data type inferred by Pandas - make sure you double check its correctness. 

3. For the UCI Adult dataset, some columns are rather redundant (e.g. `education-num`) - these can be dropped. 


Lab 2

> M2 BasicStatistics.ipynb

1. The notebook shows many types of plots (boxplot, histogram, kernel density, violin plot, joint plot, heatmap, pair plot). When choosing which kinds of plots to you, bear in mind the level of expertise your **target audience** has (not just you!). For example, violin plots seem more efficient (boxplot + kernel density plot) but a non-DS trained person will not understand it immediately without guidance. 

2. In the first set of plots for the bi-variate statistics, we can see various plots for both HP and Attack. Be careful not to draw insights just by comparing the plots in this form - the axes have different values! Make sure to set the axes to be the same range if you want to make a visual comparison. 

    ```
    for ax in axes:
        for x in ax:
            x.set_xlim(0,255)
    ```

3. Watch out for the interpretation of correlation values. Here, we are looking at **Pearson's correlation** (default option, since we didn't specify which type). So a correlation score of 0.02 between Defense and Speed means that there is no **linear** correlation - i.e. we can't explain the relationship between the features with a straight line ($y=ax$ for some constant $a$)
Looking at the pair plots gives some intuition: for the plot between Defense and Speed, there are no Pokemon with both very high Defense and Speed. A majority of them are actually close to the mean (~70) and have rather high standard deviation (~30). Looking at the formula for correlation will also give you an idea why having either X or Y close to the mean (and extremely few points on the top right) leads to a small correlation score. For any Pokemon to have significant impact on the correlation score, the values generally have to vary more than 1 standard deviation from the mean for both features. 

    $$ \rho = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} $$

    It's also useful to note that there are [many other ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_coefficient#Types) to compute correlation ; [even more ways](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3512994) to measure relationships between distributions. 

4. More details about [Kernel Density Estimator](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.13-kernel-density-estimation.html).

5. What exactly does `seaborn.set()` do? Look at the differences [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html).


> M2 ExploratoryAnalysis.ipynb

1. Why is the dtype of some columns (Name, Type) object instead of String (hint: pointers)? [Here's a hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33957720/how-to-convert-column-with-dtype-as-object-to-string-in-pandas-dataframe) and [see the other link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21018654/strings-in-a-dataframe-but-dtype-is-object) in that post too.

2. In this dataset, the NaNs in column `Type 2` are true NaNs that can't be filled with any other values - some Pokemon do not have a secondary type.

(more to come!)
