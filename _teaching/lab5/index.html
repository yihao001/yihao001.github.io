					<!-- Slide 2:1 -->

					<section data-transition="none" style="text-align: left;">

						<h3>1. Write a class in C++</h3>

						New concept: <b>Destructor</b> üóëÔ∏è

						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="1">
							~Animal() {
								cout << "destructing Animal object "<< _name << endl ;
							}
						</code></pre>

						<p class='fragment'>
						Q: Why are destructors needed in C++? <br>

							C++ does not have in-built garbage collection (there are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/81062/garbage-collection-libraries-in-c">external</a> ones), so some manual memory management is needed. But there are also <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp?view=vs-2019">smart pointers</a> now. 
						</p>
						<p class='fragment'>
						Q: Why doesn't C++ use garbage collectors? (GC works well in Java!) <br>

							It's <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/113319">complicated</a>, but tl;dr - C/C++ is a little too low level for GC to work well (+ remember that C/C++ is also meant to work on extremely low-resource settings - even a simple GC will create too much overhead)
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							"Ensures that the allocated memory is released"
							<br>
							Recall the feedback in Lab 1 where I mentioned about developing good habits like being aware about memory management!
						</aside>

					</section>

					<!-- Slide 2:2 -->

					<section data-transition="none" style="text-align: left;">
						
						<h3>2. Inheritance in C++</h3>

						New concept: <b>Pure method</b>

						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="4">
							class Shape {
								public :
								Shape() { }
								virtual void area() = 0 ;
								// virtual void area() { cout << "undefined" << endl ;}
								void name() { cout << " a shape" << endl ; }
							};

							class Rectangle : public Shape {
								...
								public :
								Rectangle(int x, int y) : _length(x) , _height(y) { }
								void area() { cout << "area is " << _length * _height << endl ; }
							}
						</code></pre>

						Basically this creates an <b>abstract method</b> and the class becomes an <b>abstract class</b> too.

						<p class='fragment'>
						// Make sure you watch out for the function signatures when you define the sub-classes - they 
						<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9488168/virtual-function-const-vs-virtual-function-non-const'>should be the same</a>!
						(i.e. if there is a `const` in your method in the superclass, it should be in your sub-class too)
						</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							"the class becomes an abstract class"
						</aside>
						
					</section>

					<!-- Slide 2:3 -->

					<section data-transition="none" style="text-align: left;">
						
						<h3>3. Polymophism in C++</h3>

						New concept: <b>virtual</b>

						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
							int main() {
								Rectangle rect(10,20);
								Shape *shapePtr = &rect ;
								Shape &shapeRef = rect ;
								Shape shapeVal = rect ;
								
								shapePtr->area() ;
								shapeRef.area() ;
								shapeVal.area() ;
							}
						</code></pre>

						What adding the keyword <b>virtual</b> does: "force method evaluation to be based on object type rather than reference type"

						<p class='fragment'>
							Without <b>virtual</b>, all 3 lines will print the same thing <br> (i.e. "undefined")
						</p>

						<p class='fragment'>
							More about pointers and references <a href="https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/cp4_PointerReference.html">here</a> (section 2.4).
						</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Refer to the code in the previous slide too (comment out the pure method and uncomment the commented line). 
							Basically, it will output 200, 200 and "undefined" (a str printed from the area() method in Shape, not like really undefined/error).
							The key takeaway is with virtual, you will see this polymorphic behaviour. Without it, you won't see (all will print "undefined").
						</aside>

					<section data-transition="none" style="text-align: left;">
						
						<h3>4. Array of Objects (build a zoo)</h3>

						Keep things simple:

						<p></p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class='fragment'>Having an array of 3 objects (üê∂,üò∏,ü¶Å) is fine, if you want to have more that's fine too as long as you don't run into any errors</li>
							<li class='fragment'>You need to initialize your arrays (e.g. 0 or Mammal object) so that you don't run into issues (like uninitialized values) when iterating through the loop when the Zoo is not full üôà</li>
							<li class='fragment'>Sending an animal to the zoo will then mean that you're replacing the value of the existing (null) value / object in the array</li>
							<li class='fragment'>Remember to free the animals at the end (i.e. delete the objects and <b>free up memory</b>)</li>
						</ul>

					</section>

					<!-- Slide 2:5 -->
					
					<section data-transition="none" style="text-align: left;">
						
						<h3>5. Header and Impelmentation</h3>

						(abstraction!)
						<p></p>
						Many different ways to do it, so it's up to you
						<p></p>
						Try to at least have animal.h, childAnimal.h, ZooMain.cpp
						<p></p>
						(But it's cleaner to have animal.cpp and childAnimal.cpp too)

						<aside class="notes">
							Recall what we talked about when discussing about Abstraction / Encapsulation in Lab 4!

						<h3>More scaffolds</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>Not in lab and Visual Studio takes up too much space? <a href='https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/'>Eclipse</a> works, <a href="https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/CodeBlocks_HowTo.html">CodeBlocks</a> too or even <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac">VSCode</a> (weird errors though)</li>
							<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2650192">Recap</a> about the difference between compiling, linking and building</li>
							<li>You might need to have <b>#include guards</b>. Here's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8020211">how it works</a>.</li>
							<li>Destructors <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7403883/derived-class-with-non-virtual-destructor">can be virtual</a> too, some IDEs might warn but it's fine</li>
							<li>You'll face issues printing the value stored in the <b>enum</b> - here's <a href="http://aantron.github.io/better-enums/">one way</a> to solve it and here are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28828957/enum-to-string-in-modern-c11-c14-c17-and-future-c20/31362042#31362042">more ways</a> to solve it. But you can fix it with switch statements too.</li>

					<h2>Take-home Messages üè† </h2>	

					<ul>
						<li class='fragment'>Knowing the <b>best tool for the job</b> makes you very valuable in the industry - be a jack of many trades (know the masters), master of one </li>
						<li class='fragment'>IRL, people use a <b>mix of paradigms</b> (depending on the team too)</li>
						<li class='fragment'>Over time, you should also develop the ability to break down a big task into smaller parts that are <b>reusable and extensible</b></li>
						<!-- Harder than it sounds - this is something that comes with experience -->
						<li class='fragment'>OOP is done at a higher level of abstraction + attributes & methods are tightly coupled - use when objects are the best representation</li>
						<ul>
							<li class='fragment'>OOP principles are not unique, but inheritance is hard to achieve without OOP (i.e. if the task can be modelled nicely with a hierarchy of classes, OOP is probably the right tool) </li>
							<li class='fragment'>The next few mods in your SCSE journey goes higher <br> (unless you're in CE, where it goes lower ü§ñ)</li>

						<!-- If you are still unsure, do what you are good at, or what you are interested in.

						<li class='fragment'>The earlier you figure out what you want to do, the better you can prepare / read ahead and you'll naturally do better. Do internships.</li>

					For more advanced customization, you do need CSS and JS but scripts can be easily googled for and it has <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">good documentation</a>.
