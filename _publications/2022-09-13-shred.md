Cohort-specific insights from small datasets can now be created from site-specific biomarkers and insights relevant to the general population are obtained from the site-invariant biomarkers.'

Many research and medical institutions collect data to study complex neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.
These disorders (such as ASD and ADHD) are understood to be heterogeneous: the development of the disorder often varies across factors such as age, gender or ethnicity. However, datasets collected at individual sites tend to be small and not always representative of inter-site variability. This makes such disorders difficult to study as studies performed on each site might seem to produce contradictory findings, making the goal of producing generalisable treatments seem elusive.

In the face of these issues, there are presently several possible lines of research:

1. Focusing on **site-specific** biomarkers: There could be aspects of the disease that are unique to specific populations (which would be of interest to researchers studying that population, e.g. Asians). Here, we can only rely on our local dataset. We can fit a model and find the most important features (i.e. potential biomarkers) but how do we isolate site-specific biomarkers from site-invariant ones, or even whether they are actually noise (especially since the dataset is small)?
2. Generalising to **site-invariant** biomarkers: There could still be biomarkers that are common to the wider population (which would be of interest to an multinational pharmaceutical company looking for therapeutic targets). How do we arrive at them without having to manually fit models on each site and study the biomarkers one by one?

In recent years, researchers have increasingly gravitated towards gathering data from multiple sites (some driven by the desire to boost statistical power of these studies, some perhaps motivated by the perception that deep learning models require more data). Approches of pooling datasets together range from assembling multi-site data into a uniform file format and folder structure (e.g. ABIDE, ADHD-200, SchizConnect) to carefully designed and enforced data collection protocols that have to be observed at all sites to minimise site differences (e.g. ADNI, PPMI). The latter is ideal since it minimises site effects, but the process is labourious. We also need solutions to better make use of the datasets that fall under the former category, which is at present much more prevalent than the latter.

In this work, we show that:
- Even if models 'overfit' on small individual datasets, there is still value in such models as they could provide site-specific biomarkers. Many works raise the issue of deep learning models  In the first place, generalisation ability is unlikely to be the main focus for biomarker studies conducted in a specific population so overfitting should not be a reason to abandon the model altogether. That said, work still has to be done to determine whether the biomarkers provide valuable signals, or might have captured 'noise' (features that indeed were useful for the model to perform classification in that data subset, but do not end up becoming useful biomarkers).
- While the most intuitive way to arrive at site-invariant biomarkers is to work on pooled datasets put together by data consortiums, this needs to be done carefully. If imbalances exist across sites, biomarkers produced could be biased towards the largest site - i.e. the biomarkers are not as generalised as one might have assumed.
- We propose a technique to separate site-invariant biomarkers from site-specific ones, making it possible to pursue both types of studies from existing datasets collected from consortiums such as ABIDE and ADHD-200.

Let’s start off with the assumption that we’re working on a data modality with the right information to bring us closer to an explanation of the causes of a disease. We have the correct modality, but we haven’t found the needles in the haystack yet. If we had a powerful metal detector, we would have been able to see this:

![Each box represents a feature and boxes in red represent potential biomarkers (most important features).](./figures_shred/ground_truth.png)

This disease is a particular complex and heterogeneous one. The way it affect people varies across geographies (let’s call each place a site). Let’s assume that there are similarities shared across sites, but each site also has its own unique differences - that makes it really confusing and difficult for us to derive useful insights from the data.

At this point, there are 2 things we could do:
1. Study site-specific causes of the disease
2. Study site-invariant causes of the disease

Each haystack comes at a significant cost, so there are only so much haystacks a site can produce for analysis. To complicate things, each bale of hay is packaged in quite a different way (site differences). To make matters worse, the needles are in different orientations (labelling inconsistencies) and our metal detector isn’t quite powerful enough to sense them if they aren’t upright. Sometimes, the haystacks have other objects that the metal detector picks up too…

One way researchers have attempted to approach this problem is to pool datasets from multiple sites together.
