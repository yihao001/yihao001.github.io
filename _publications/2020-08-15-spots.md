**tl;dr**

We proposed a customised architecture, Salient Patterns Over Time and Space (`SPOTS`), for decoding brain task states. SPOTS considers both spatial and temporal relationships via the combination of spatial embedding and an attention mechanism, resulting in improvements to model performance especially for smaller window sizes (which the present state of the art struggles with).

Poster, Video and Code for `SPOTS` can be found [here](https://github.com/SCSE-Biomedical-Computing-Group/SPOTS).
