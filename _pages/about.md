<br>
I’m Yihao, a 4th year PhD candidate in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I’ve done my undergraduate degrees (Business and Computer Science) in NTU as well, with specializations in Business Analytics, Data Science & Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.

My research interests are within the intersection of Computer Science and Neuroscience, specifically Multiview Representation Learning and Multimodal Neuroimaging Analysis. My key interest is to contribute towards a better understanding of structure-function relationships in the human brain, for both normal function and various disease states.

A long term goal I have is to improve learning and memory in both humans and machines: in the process understanding how we can better describe and treat learning and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as atypical neurodegeneration.
