Iâ€™m currently a postdoctoral fellow in the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Iâ€™ve completed my undergraduate degrees (Business and Computing, with specialisations in Business Analytics, Data Science & Analytics, AI) and PhD (Computer Science, specifically in brain imaging, multimodal learning and explainable AI) in NTU as well.

My research interests are within the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Neuroscience**. Currently, my main research focus is on **Temporal Graph Interpretability**. Specifically, I am interested in modelling multimodal datasets of human brain activity to identify salient spatiotemporal patterns, improving our understanding of structure-function relationships (especially in disorder states).

A long term goal I have is to improve learning and memory in both humans and machines, in the process understanding how we can better treat learning and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as atypical neurodegeneration. Outside of my research, I have an interest in developing DS/AI solutions unique to SG and applying temporal graphs to other domains (e.g. quantitative finance).
