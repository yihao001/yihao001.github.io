<br>
I’m Yihao, a Research Fellow in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I’ve done my undergraduate degrees (Business and Computer Science, with specializations in Business Analytics, Data Science & Analytics and AI) and PhD (Computer Science, specifically in AI) in NTU as well. My research interests are primarily within the intersection of Neural Networks and Neuroscience. During my PhD studies, I developed techniques to model high dimensional multimodal datasets that are small (i.e. large p, small n). Specifically, custom graph neural networks and explainable AI techniques were created to derive connectome-based biomarkers that are more granular. These techniques go beyond existing class-wide approaches by producing individualised and subgroup-specific insights that would be more clinically relevant than existing solutions.

Currently, my main research focus is on **Temporal Graph Interpretability**. Specifically, I am interested in modelling multimodal datasets of human brain activity and identifying salient spatiotemporal patterns in them, contributing towards a better understanding of structure-function relationships in the human brain (especially in disorder states) as well as extending the applications of these models to other domains with temporal graphs (e.g. quantiative finance). 

A long term goal I have is to improve learning and memory in both humans and machines, in the process understanding how we can better treat learning and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as atypical neurodegeneration. Outside of research, I'm interested in developing clinically deployable tools for medical AI applications.
