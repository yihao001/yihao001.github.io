Investigations into multi-view learning

Even more features

Instead of pruning, why not consolidate similar signals? 



similarity-contrastive learning 


ReLU, throw neg. can do opp relu and retain the neg info? 


y = wx + b
h1 = sig(wx + b) = sig(w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + b) ; additive 

n1 = sig(vh + b) = sig(v1 sig(w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + b) + v2h2 + ... + b) 

do we need so many nested non-linearity? 


each node in the NN does signal consolidation 


1 node views? what's the diff
